Allows affiliates to promote external landing pages by including the affiliate's ID or username in any outbound links to your e-commerce store.

== Description ==

> This plugin was built to be used in conjunction with [AffiliateWP](http://affiliatewp.com/ "AffiliateWP").

Like other affiliate plugins, AffiliateWP must be installed on the same domain as your e-commerce system (Easy Digital Downloads, WooCommerce etc) to properly track visits and referrals.

This plugin allows your affiliates to promote any landing page (or site) that exists on a completely separate domain. Simply install this plugin on the external WordPress site and your affiliates can now promote it using the site's URL and their affiliate ID appended (eg /?ref=123). If a customer uses the affiliate's referral URL, any outbound links to your e-commerce store will automatically include the affiliate's ID. If the customer then makes a purchase on your e-commerce store, the proper affiliate will be awarded commission. The affiliate's ID is stored in a cookie so even if the customer moves between pages on your site, the outbound links will still have the affiliate's ID appended.
